summary: The F-22 Raptor, developed by Lockheed Martin, is a fifth-generation,
  single-seat, twin-engine stealth tactical fighter aircraft designed for the
  United States Air Force. Combining stealth, speed, agility, and situational
  awareness with lethal long-range air-to-air and air-to-ground capabilities,
  the F-22 represents a monumental leap in aerial warfare technology. It remains
  one of the most advanced and capable fighter jets in the world.

### Introduction

The **F-22 Raptor** was born out of the United States' need for air dominance in the 21st century. Originally conceived in the 1980s as part of the Advanced Tactical Fighter (ATF) program, the aircraft made its first flight in 1997 and entered service in 2005. With its revolutionary design and advanced features, the F-22 sets the standard for modern combat aircraft.

### Design and Performance

The F-22 features a **sleek, angular design** optimized for stealth, significantly reducing its radar cross-section. It is powered by **two Pratt & Whitney F119-PW-100 turbofan engines**, which enable **supercruise**—sustained supersonic flight without afterburners. This feature gives the F-22 an unmatched speed and endurance advantage in combat scenarios.

The aircraft's **thrust-vectoring nozzles** contribute to its extraordinary agility, allowing it to execute maneuvers beyond the capabilities of any other operational fighter jet.

### Stealth and Survivability

One of the F-22’s standout features is its **stealth capability**. It uses radar-absorbing materials, internal weapons bays, and precisely engineered surfaces to remain undetected by enemy radar systems. This allows it to penetrate heavily defended airspace and engage targets with minimal risk of detection.

In addition, its **advanced electronic warfare systems** can jam enemy radar and communication systems, enhancing both survivability and offensive capability.

### Avionics and Sensor Fusion

The F-22 is equipped with cutting-edge avionics, including the **AN/APG-77 Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) radar**, which provides the pilot with a comprehensive view of the battlespace. Through **sensor fusion**, the aircraft combines data from multiple onboard and external sources to provide real-time situational awareness, enabling faster and more accurate decision-making.

### Armament

The F-22 carries its primary weapons internally to maintain stealth. Its **standard loadout** includes:

* **6 AIM-120 AMRAAM** (Advanced Medium-Range Air-to-Air Missiles)
* **2 AIM-9 Sidewinder** short-range missiles
* **1 M61A2 20mm cannon** for close-range dogfighting

It can also be equipped with **precision-guided bombs** such as the **GBU-32 JDAM** for ground attack missions, making it a formidable multirole platform.

### Operational History

While the F-22 was designed primarily for air-to-air combat, it has seen limited deployment in **combat zones like Syria**, where it performed precision strikes and showed dominance in maintaining air superiority.

Although production ceased in 2012 due to high costs and a shift in defense priorities, the USAF continues to operate a fleet of **around 180 F-22 Raptors**, regularly upgrading them with modern avionics and software to maintain their edge.
